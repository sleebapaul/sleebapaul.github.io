# About Me

Hi, I'm Sleeba Paul. I adore building things and telling stories.

I practice Machine Learning for love and living. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Refly, an AI startup where we work on content enrichment and video analytics. I’m a Power System major; one may not find notable similarity between my academic background and the work I do. Well, I don’t see it either :D

But, when it comes to working, I adopt the following quote from Stanford commencement speech of Steve Jobs in 2005 is the philosophy.

>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.

A car which drives autonomously thrills me. A machine talks to me like another human excites me. When I learn and build intelligent machine applications, I get the feeling that I’m doing great work.

Next is storytelling. From Jesus to Muhammad, all explained abstract ideas using examples. Why?

>Teach the concept in concrete examples. People don’t get abstract idea without examples. - Bjarne Stroustrup

I’m a firm advocate of knowledge transfer through stories, especially in fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. I vest my effort on this objective whenever I try to produce original content.

So that’s about me. It doesn't mean that I'm well-wrapped by these sentences. Still, it conveys the fringe of my perspective on life.  

Thanks!
