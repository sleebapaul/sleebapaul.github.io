Sleeba has research interests in computational neuroscience and artificial general
intelligence. He is curious about layers of a human emotions and the idea of emotion
mappings between people. He believes that empathy in its purest form can be achieved if
the emotion of a person can be mapped to another efficiently. Sleeba is a firm advocate of
knowledge transfer through stories, especially in the fields of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics.
