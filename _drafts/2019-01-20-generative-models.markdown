**Disclaimer**

This tutorial series will be on Generative Models, with an intended inclination towards Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Since GANs are an advanced topic in Deep Learning, the audience are expected to have knowledge in basic probability, neural networks, and how we train them.

## Introduction 

Let's think about it. How this world around us is known to us? How we know if it is a car? A doll? An umbrella? 


It is all about patterns. The mysterious `3 pounds` inside our skull somehow understand these patterns and discriminate them for us. Pattern recognition is such an effortless task for us, that too in lightning speed, with impeccable accuracy and consistancy. Pretty amazing right? Not yet. Because our brain is a lot more than a mere pattern recognizer. 

Think about this one. Most of us have never met a car accident in our life. But we can anticipate one. 

> Okay, I can see there's a hairpin curve ahead. 

> Oh really! Then if we go too fast, the bike might skid. 

> Yeah, it could lead to an accident.

> Uh-oh there is a chasm to the right of curve as well. 

> If we skid, we could fall into that chasm.  

> BREAKS ... NOW NOW NOW!!!

Our brain does these simulations of possible futures continuously. That's how we interact with our surroundings in real time. `Imagination` is the most astonishing virtue of our brain. 

Descriminative and Generative Models

I have mentioned two real life examples above. Let's see them in a little mathematical perspective.

First problem of recognizing patterns in
