## Disclaimer

This tutorial series will be on Generative Models, with an intended inclination towards Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Since GANs are an advanced topic in Deep Learning, the audience are expected to have knowledge in basic probability, neural networks, and how we train them.

# Generative Models

Let's think about it. How this world around us is known to us? How we know if it is a car? A doll? An umbrella? 


It is all about patterns. The mysterious `3 pounds` inside our skull somehow understand these patterns and discriminate them for us. Pattern recognition is such an effortless task for us, that too in lightning speed, with impeccable accuracy and consistancy. Pretty amazing right? Not yet.

Now think about this one. Most of us have never met a car accident in our life. But we can anticipate one. Okay, there's a hairpin curve ahead, and if we go too fast, the car might skid. It could lead to an accident and some many unpleasant outcomes. 

How do we do these simulations of possible futures in our mind? How the gift of `imagination` works? 

Let's learn about Generative Models :smile:
