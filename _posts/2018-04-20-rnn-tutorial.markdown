We've already achieved a lot of milestones in Deep Learning (DL). Still, calling it Artificial Intelligence is not appropriate since solving intelligence is a whole new ball game. But some leaps in DL give us hope that one day we'll solve intelligence. Not necessarily with DL, but somehow we'll solve it and finally attain Artificial Intelligence or ambitiously Artificial General Intelligence. Such a leap is Google Translate which supports 103 languages now and it's almost perfect. This is an end-to-end DL application. Now, an end to end DL application is important since we are not teaching a network to learn read a word, but a sentence.
